<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

You can access all the exercises. It is divided in 2 parts (SOLID principles and Software design patterns). In the design patterns you'll see the exercises divided by the pattern type (Behavioral, Creational or Structural).
At the end all is divided in 2 directories, one for the exercises done by me and the other for the solutions provided by the course instructor.
